**Energy-Aware Clustering and Sleep Scheduling with Federated Learning for Faulty Node Detection in Wireless Sensor Networks**

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a simulation model to enhance the performance of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) by incorporating:
- **Federated Learning** for decentralized training,
- **Energy-Aware Clustering** (e.g., LEACH),
- **Sleep Scheduling** for energy conservation, and
- **Faulty Node Detection** and classification.

The approach aims to optimize energy usage and improve the reliability of data in WSNs, especially for applications such as environmental monitoring and forest fire detection.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🌐 **Federated Learning**: Ensures data privacy by training local models at each sensor node.
- 🔋 **Energy-Aware Clustering**: Selects cluster heads based on energy levels to reduce transmission cost.
- 🛏 **Sleep Scheduling**: Nodes dynamically enter sleep mode to save power.
- ⚠️ **Fault Detection & Classification**: Identifies faulty nodes using anomaly detection on local and global models.


## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- No additional dependencies required

### How to Run

1. Open `simulation.js` in a browser-based environment or embed it in an HTML file.
2. Visualize the simulation and data flow within the WSN.
3. Modify parameters in the script to test different clustering or scheduling strategies.

### (Optional) Embedding in HTML

To test the script in a browser, you can wrap it like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>WSN Simulation</title>
</head>
<body>
  <script src="simulation.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
